# Booking-Event
A website for booking a soccer field that allows users to select 2 types of soccer fields.

For the front page, just have introduction, images, videos, details, and will have a button that will lead to the booking system.

For the booking system, will let customer to choose type of field, slot(time(90 min) and date), name (usually will put their team name vs the opponent team), and submit button.
Also, customers can see the booking schedules.

Using HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript.


In the future, we want to add tournament/leagues/championship schedules where it can be used to upload live scores so customers can visit the website to see updates for the leagues/championship that been held on the soccer field.
